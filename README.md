- General event system via scriptable objects
  - to trigger an event to which anyone can respond
  - good for getting rid of the "Singleton" over usage 
- Scene transitions
  - Simple scene transition object
    - as it is now it is based on the animator with two states, but it is prepared for shader transitions in future
