# LudumDare2D basic template

## Contains

- Global event system via scriptable objects
  - to trigger an event to which anyone can respond
  - cool to help rid of the "Singleton" over usage 
- Scene transitions
  - Simple scene transition object
    - as it is now it is based on the animator with two states, but it is prepared for shader transitions in future   
- Type writter
  - it will take text and make it appear letter by letter
  - start of the future dialogue system

## Planned

- 2D APathFinding algorithm where walkable area will be set by polygon collider

- Dialogue system
